USER: To Insert activity [bpmn]:use the following mutator operator:     s = select one Sequence where {^to not typed EndEv}
    f = select one FlowObject in s->^to
    a = create Activity with {name = 'newActivity'}
    modify target ^to from s to a
    create Sequence with {name = 'newSeq', ^from = a, ^to = f}

USER: To Remove activity [bpmn]:use the following mutator operator:     s0 = select one Sequence where {^to is typed Activity}
    a = select one Activity in s0->^to
    s1 = select one Sequence where {^from = a}
    f = select one FlowObject in s1->^to
    remove a, s1
    modify target ^to from s0 to f

USER: To Move activity [bpmn]:use the following mutator operator:     a = select one Activity
    s0 = select one Sequence where {^to = a and ^from <> null}
    s1 = select one Sequence where {^from = a and ^to <> null}
    o = select one FlowObject where {self = s1->^to}
    s2 = select one Sequence where {^from = o and ^to <> null}
    modify s0 with {^to = o},
           s1 with {^from = o, ^to = a},
           s2 with {^from = a}

USER: To Replace activity [bpmn]:use the following mutator operator:     a0 = select one Activity
    src0 = select one Sequence where {^to = a0}
    tar0 = select one Sequence where {^from = a0}
    a1 = select one Activity where {self <> a0}
    src1 = select one Sequence where {^to = a1}
    tar1 = select one Sequence where {^from = a1}
    modify src0 with {^to = a1}, tar0 with {^from = a1},
           src1 with {^to = a0}, tar1 with {^from = a0}

USER: To Retype activity [bpmn]:use the following mutator operator:     retype one [AND, OR, XOR] as [AND, OR, XOR]
