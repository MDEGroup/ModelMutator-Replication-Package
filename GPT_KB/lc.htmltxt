#TUTORIAL

USER: To Retype a two-pinned gate as a two-pinned gate of a different type [lc]:use the following mutator operator: retype one [AND, OR] as [AND, OR] 

USER: To Swap the input pins of two different gates [lc]:use the following mutator operator: g0 = select one Gate
modify one Gate where {self <> g0} with {swapref(input, g0->input)}

USER: To Removes a NOT gate [lc]:use the following mutator operator: n0 = select one NOT where {input->src <> null and output->tar <> null}
i0 = select one InputPin in n0->output->tar
o0 = select one OutputPin in n0->input->src
modify i0 with {src = o0}
remove n0

USER: To Adds a NOT gate [lc]:use the following mutator operator: g0 = select one Gate where {input <> null and output <> null}
n1 = create NOT with {name = random-string(2, 4)}
o0 = select one OutputPin in g0->output
i0 = select one InputPin in o0->tar
create OutputPin in n1->output 
    with {name = random-string(2, 4), tar = i0}
create InputPin in n1->input 
    with {name = random-string(2, 4), src = o0}
